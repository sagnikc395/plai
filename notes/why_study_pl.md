## Why Study Programming Languages ?

- Programming languages are some of the most beautiful and powerful
objects invented by human beings.
- They let us - indeed, force us to - capture our thoughts precisely, and in return
command machines of immense power to do our bidding.
- To a programmer,they are the ultimate HCI.
- They are industrially important -> impo that major companies create new
languages or co-opt exisitng ones to establish or expand thier market share.
- They embody a new form of knowledge -> procedural epistemology.
- Enable us to prove powerful statements about the means and limits of our expression.
