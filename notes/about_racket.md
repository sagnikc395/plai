## A few high level facts about Racket

- Dynamically Typed:
  - variables are untyped, values are typed

- Functional:
  - Racket emphasizes functional style
    - Compositional -> emphasized black-box components
    - Immutability -> requires automatic memory management

- Imperative:
  - Allows data to be modified in carefully considered cases,
  but doesn't emphaizes "impure" code.

- Object Oriented
  - Racket has a powerful object system

- Language Oriented
  - Racket is really a language toolkit

- Homoiconic
  - the same structure used to represent data (lists) is also used
  to represent code.
