## SMoL -> Standard Model of Languages

- Embodiment of the computational core of many of the widely-used
PL, from C# -> Java -> JS,Lua, Python and Ruby to OCaml and Racket.
- This commonality pays no respect to "paradigms", rather all these
languages (and many others) , to a large extent , have a common computational core.
- Safe runtime systems, automated memory management, eager evaluation,
- first-class lexically scoped functions, first-order mutable variables
- first-class mutable structures

- Contemporary programming demands a deep understanding of these.
- Even "standard" features have historically seen variation.
- therefore, while we progress across features, we also want to study variation
within them.
- we do this by using the mystery language approach: with a fixed syntax, we explore
the differeent ways the same feature can behave.
